            <p class="sumprojectpara">  In an interaction design methods course, our team was given the task to design a solution for a designated group. The group that we encountered was the Simon Fraser University Satellite Design Team. Through observations, interviews, and workshops, we discovered that this team had a difficult time recruiting new members. Therefore, we decided aim towards finding solution for this problem.  </p>

          <p class="projectpara"> The process begins with all three of us pitching an idea to one another. I pitched the idea of focusing on biometric data and how it can be hacked. Many critiques and feedback later, we combined biometric data and children mobile use together. This left us with the core idea that we see in our final project.   </p>

          <h1 class="roletitle1"> MY ROLE  </h1>
          <p class="projectpara"> Throughout the weeks of this project, my main role was to graphic and interface design. Each week, we were assigned posters to create in order to present our findings and ideas to our peers. These weeks were vital to our project as they were the building blocks to what our final product would become. I had designed posters for personas, ideas, cultural probes, and workshops. In addition, I also designed mock-ups for the mobile application and kiosk. </p>

          <h1 class="roletitle1"> CHALLENGES  </h1>
          <p class="projectpara"> One of the major challenges that we faced as a group was trying to narrow down what core problem that we could fix using a digital medium. With different user surveys and ideas, we came up with a digital kiosk and mobile application. My challenge was to research what a kiosk user interface would look like as it wasn't a common interface to produce.</p>

          <p class="projectpara"> For the final showcase, we showcased a working prototype of our kiosk, a working prototype of our mobile application, as well as an informational poster. My task for this final week was creating the interface of the kiosk, as well as designing the informational poster. Our project garnered a tremendous response from the public, which resulted in a strong grade from our evaluators.</p>

          <p class="sumprojectpara">In the end, this project was able to create great opportunities in furthing my graphic and interface design skills. Each week brought a different challenge in designing a visual poster, which I was able to achieve. Furthermore, improvements were clearly visible through how the posters looked after each week.</p>
